# Algorithms in Java

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This repository contains my solution for common algorithms. I've created this repository to learn about algorithms and improve solutions to common computer science problems. Each solution has a Java program and is tested. 

## Problems

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Cyclic Sort
- Min-Max 
- Linear Search 
- Binary Search (Iterative)
- Binary Search (Recursion)
- Knapsack Problem Using Greedy Approach
- Knapsack Problem Using Dynamic Programming
- All Pair Shortest Path
- Graph Colouring
- Naive String Search
- Longest Common Subsequences
- N-Queens Using Backtracking
- N-Queens Using Branch and Bound
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Sum of Subsets
- Matrix Chain Multiplication
